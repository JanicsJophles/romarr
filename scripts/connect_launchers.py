"""Connect the launchers on this PC to ROMarr, in one command.

ROMarr usually runs on a server; the launchers are on the machine you play
on. This is the bridge: it scans every launcher installed here -- Steam,
Epic, GOG Galaxy, Battle.net, EA -- and pushes the titles to ROMarr as an
import list, which then feeds Wanted on ROMarr's normal schedule.

    python scripts/connect_launchers.py --url http://romarr:6868 --key <api key>

    --dry-run       show what would be sent, send nothing
    --platform      file every title against one platform (default: per line)

No store credentials are involved anywhere in this. The launchers already
wrote your library to disk when they installed it; this reads those files.
