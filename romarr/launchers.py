"""Reading the launchers already installed on a gaming PC.

**This module exists because a claim in ROMarr's own README was wrong.** It
said EA, Battle.net, Epic and Nintendo "have no API", so their libraries
could not be connected. Playnite and LaunchBox have managed those libraries
for years, which was the counter-example that mattered -- and the way they
do it is not a secret API at all:

    the launcher already wrote your library to disk.

Steam keeps an `appmanifest_*.acf` per installed game. Epic writes a JSON
`.item` per game. GOG Galaxy keeps a SQLite database. Battle.net keeps a
protobuf `product.db` naming each installed product. EA writes an
`installerdata.xml` beside each game. None of that needs a credential, an
OAuth dance or a scraped cookie -- it needs read access to the machine the
person is already sitting at.

So this is the honest architecture for store libraries: the *web* APIs
(Steam public profile, GOG public profile, Xbox, PSN, itch.io) cover what
you own remotely, and this covers what is installed locally, including
every store that has no usable web API at all. Between them there is no
"cannot connect" left worth printing in a README.

Everything here is a pure function from a path to a list of titles, so all
of it is tested, and `scan_all` degrades per-launcher: a machine with no
Epic simply contributes no Epic games rather than failing the scan.
