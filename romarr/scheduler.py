"""The clock. Everything ROMarr does on its own schedule goes through here.

Until now ROMarr only acted when asked: a search happened when somebody typed
one, and "Import completed downloads automatically" was a checkbox that
nothing read. Every other *arr -- and Questarr, which is where the pressure
to fix this came from -- runs its acquisition on a clock: completed downloads
are imported within a minute, the Wanted list is re-searched on an interval,
and the indexers' RSS feeds are watched between searches so a release that
appears an hour after you asked is grabbed an hour after it appears, not a
fortnight later when the next manual search happens to run.

One thread, not one per job. The jobs are all short and none may overlap
itself, so a single loop that asks "who is due" every tick is simpler to
reason about and impossible to leak. A job that raises is recorded and
rescheduled, never dropped: the scheduler surviving its jobs is the whole
point of having one.

Intervals are read through a callable at every tick rather than captured at
registration, so changing a setting applies at the next tick without a
restart. An interval of zero means "off", which is how a checkbox disables a
job without the scheduler needing to know checkboxes exist.
