"""What a ROM actually is, read from its bytes rather than its name.

ROMarr trusts the file extension. That is right almost always and wrong in the
case that costs the most: a file renamed by hand, by a scene release, or by a
frontend that guessed. It is then filed under the wrong platform, and the
symptom appears much later as a game that will not boot.

Yarr.It, which plays ROMs in the browser, already reads the header before
choosing an emulator core -- its test suite names the case directly: "a Mega
Drive rom that somebody renamed .nes". It has to, because handing EmulatorJS
the wrong core produces a black screen rather than an error. ROMarr files the
same files and had no equivalent, so this closes that gap on our side.

Only signatures that are genuinely distinctive are here. A format identified by
"it is the right length" is not identification, and guessing confidently is
worse than saying nothing: `identify` returns None when it does not know, and
every caller treats that as "no opinion", never as "wrong".
