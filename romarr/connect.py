"""One-click account connect, using the browser session you already have.

The point of this module is a button. Not a script, not a pasted key for
the common case -- a button on ROMarr's own page that lands you on a store
you are *already signed in to*, takes one confirming click there, and comes
back with your library connected.

That is possible because of how each store actually works, and the honest
answer differs per store rather than being one grand scheme:

  * **Steam** is a true one-click. "Sign in through Steam" is OpenID 2.0,
    an official public flow that needs no API key, no app registration and
    no secret -- the browser round-trips to Steam, Steam asserts which
    account you are, and ROMarr verifies that assertion directly with
    Steam. Combined with the public profile game list, that is a complete
    connection from one click.
  * **GOG** uses an OAuth login page whose redirect must be a URI GOG
    already trusts, so the code lands in the address bar rather than back
    at ROMarr. One click to open, one copy.
  * **PlayStation, Xbox, itch.io** issue tokens from a page inside your
    signed-in account. One click to open the exact page, one copy.

Everything here treats the outside world as untrusted: an OpenID assertion
is verified with Steam rather than believed, the identity it returns is
matched against Steam's own URL shape, and the `state`/`return_to` values
are generated here rather than accepted from a caller -- an open redirect
in a connect flow is how somebody else's account gets linked to yours.
