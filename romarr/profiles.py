"""Operator policy over the scorer.

Two things every *arr has and ROMarr did not: a way to say "prefer this, never
that", and a way to say "never offer me this exact release again".

Both exist elsewhere as flat lists -- a set of words, a set of ids. The
difference here is that ROMarr's scorer already explains itself release by
release, so both of these can be *visible*:

  * a preferred term appears in `Judgement.why()` with the points it added, so
    an operator can see their own policy working rather than infer it from a
    changed outcome;
  * a blocklist entry carries the reason it was blocked and when, so "why will
    it never take this one" has an answer that is not "look in the logs".

"Why did it take that one" and "why will it never take this one" are the two
questions anybody actually asks about an *arr, and a flat list answers
neither.
