# Two stages, because of one dependency. ROMarr is stdlib plus `requests`, and
# requests pulls in charset-normalizer, which ships no musl wheel for every
# architecture. On linux/arm/v7 pip therefore compiles it, and a compiler in
# the final image would be ~180MB of toolchain nobody runs. So the build stage
# owns the toolchain and the runtime stage receives only the result.

# su-exec drops privileges in the entrypoint; it takes numeric ids, so no

# libarchive-tools provides bsdtar, which is what reads .7z and .rar. It is
# not optional cargo: the disc platforms this image now supports ship almost
# entirely as .7z, so without it every PlayStation, PS2 and Wii import fails
# on a format it cannot open. Alpine's busybox `tar` is not a substitute and
# is deliberately not accepted -- see romarr/library.py::_bsdtar.
