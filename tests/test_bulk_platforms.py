"""The platforms added so two measured backlogs could actually be loaded.

Nothing was blocking these games except a missing row in `platforms.py`. Two
separate pipelines had already done their work and stopped at the same wall:

  * Archive.org -- 64,953 items across eleven collections that
    `index-unmappable.json` recorded as "no romm platform", including 42,254
    Apple II items of which 22,473 are already written to `idx-appleii.jsonl`.
  * Vimm's Lair -- 7,353 of 22,803 catalogued titles skipped with the reason
    "no ROMarr platform slug", 3,406 of them Xbox 360 digital releases.

Every slug below is RomM's own `fs_slug`, read off the live library rather
than composed, because the slug IS the folder a download lands in. That makes
these strings the load-bearing part of the change: rename one and the files go
somewhere RomM will not look. Every display name is likewise RomM's own, and
`resolve` matches exactly, so a name that is not declared is a platform that
cannot be reached from the catalogue at all.
