"""The Docker install surface, pinned at the level a reader trusts.

None of this can start a container in CI, so each test asserts the property
whose absence produced a real failure, and names the failure. All four were
observed on a live Docker host before they were fixed:

  * `${VAR:-?ERROR}` was documented as fail-fast validation and is not. `:-`
    supplies a default, so the second compose file quietly set the Prowlarr
    API key to the literal string "?ERROR" and connected with it.
  * Placeholder bind-mount paths are not inert. Docker creates a missing
    source, so `/path/to/roms` produced a container that started, reported
    healthy, and filed ROMs into a directory nothing scanned.
  * A `docker run` with no restart policy does not survive a host reboot, and
    the README's command was the one people copy.
  * The entrypoint's writability check ran as root, which passes `test -w` on
    nearly everything, so it could not fail for the reason it printed.
